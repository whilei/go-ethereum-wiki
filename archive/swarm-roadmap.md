# swarm roadmap 

In brief we group the tasks under various tracks that roughly correspond to subpackages of the swarm codebase

* api
* network
* storage
* services
* examples
* testing
* documentation

The features and enhancements below will be prioritised and for the basis of the various POC sprints starting Q2 2016

## Testing

### Stages of network (testing)

* [ ] see that private network is working correctly
* [ ] see that the private network is working and benchmarking the influence of block propagation gives satisfying results
* [ ] an upgraded swarm on a private network is opened up for public participation
* [ ] the private test network with community gives us another order of magnitude bigger network to test on
* [ ] homestead-compatible swarm is joining the Morden testnet
* [ ] swarm integrated in Mist and allowed on the main net
* [ ] with POC 0.2 homestead-compatible on a toy testnet 
* [ ] continue to expand and open to the public
* [ ] abstract network simulation framework using shadow
