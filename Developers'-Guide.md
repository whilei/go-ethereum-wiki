# Developers' guide 

This document is the entry point for developers of the etherum go implementation. Developers here refer to the hands-on: who are interested in build, develop, debug, submit a bug report or pull request or contribute to `go-ethereum` with code. 

## Build and Test

### Go environment  

We assume that you have [`go` v1.4 installed](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/wiki/Installing-Go), and `GOPATH` is set.

**Note**:You must have your working copy under `$GOPATH/src/github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum`. You also usually want to checkout the `develop` branch (instead of master).

Since `go` does not use relative path for import, working in any other directory will have no effect, since the import paths will be appended to `$GOPATH/src`, and if the lib does not exist, the version at master HEAD will be downloaded.

Most likely you will be working from your fork of `go-ethereum`, let's say from `github.com/nirname/go-ethereum`. Clone or move your fork into the right place:

```
git clone git@github.com:nirname/go-ethereum.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum
```

### Godep for dependency management
go-ethereum uses [Godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) to manage dependencies.

Install godep: 

```
go get github.com/tools/godep
```

Make sure that go binaries are on your executable path:

```
PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
```

`godep` should be prepended to all go calls `build`, `install` and `test`. 

Alternatively, you can prepend the go-ethereum Godeps directory to your current `GOPATH`:

```
GOPATH=`godep path`:$GOPATH
```

### Building executables

Switch to the go-ethereum repository root directory (Godep expects a local [Godeps folder](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/tree/develop/Godeps) ).

Each wrapper/executable found in 
[the `cmd` directory](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/tree/develop/cmd) can be built individually.

### Building Geth (CLI)

**Note**: Geth (the ethereum command line client) is the focus of the [Frontier release](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/wiki/Frontier).

To build the CLI:

```
godep go install -v ./cmd/geth
```

See the [documentation on how to use Geth](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/wiki/Geth)

Read about cross compilation of go-ethereum [here](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/wiki/Cross-compiling-Ethereum).

### Git flow

To make life easier try [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) it sets this all up and streamlines your work flow.

### Testing

Testing one library:

```
godep go test -v -cpu 4 ./eth  
```

Using options `-cpu` (number of cores allowed) and `-v` (logging even if no error) is recommended.

Testing only some methods:

```
godep go test -v -cpu 4 ./eth -run TestMethod
```

**Note**: here all tests with prefix _TestMethod_ will be run, so if you got TestMethod, TestMethod1, then both!

Running benchmarks, eg.:

```
cd bzz
godep go test -v -cpu 4 -bench . -run BenchmarkJoin
```

for more see [go test flags](http://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Description_of_testing_flags)

See integration testing information on the [Testing wiki page](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/wiki/Testing)

### Metrics and monitoring

`geth` can do node behaviour monitoring, aggregation and show performance metric charts. 
Read about [metrics and monitoring](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/wiki/Metrics-and-Monitoring)

### Add and update dependencies 

To update a dependency version (for example, to include a new upstream fix), run 

```
go get -u <foo/bar>
godep update <foo/...>
```

To track a new dependency, add it to the project as normal than run 

```
godep save ./...
```

Changes to the [Godeps folder](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/tree/develop/Godeps) should be manually verified then committed.

## Contributing

Only github is used to track issues. (Please include the commit and branch when reporting an issue.)

Pull requests should by default commit on the `develop` branch.
The `master` branch is only used for finished stable major releases.

## Stacktrace

The code uses `pprof` on localhost port 6060 by default if `geth` is started with the `--pprof` option. So bring up http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof to see the heap, running routines etc. By clicking full goroutine stack dump (clicking http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=2) you can generate trace that is useful for debugging.

Note that if you run multiple instances of `geth`, this port will only work for the first instance that was launched. If you want to generate stacktraces for these other instances, you need to start them up choosing an alternative pprof port. Make sure you are redirecting stderr to a logfile. 

```
geth -port=30300 -loglevel 5 --pprof --pprofport 6060 2>> /tmp/00.glog
geth -port=30301 -loglevel 5 --pprof --pprofport 6061 2>> /tmp/01.glog
geth -port=30302 -loglevel 5 --pprof --pprofport 6062 2>> /tmp/02.glog
```

Alternatively if you want to kill the clients (in case they hang or stalled synching, etc) but have the stacktrace too, you can use the `-QUIT` signal with `kill`:

```
killall -QUIT geth 
```

This will dump stracktraces for each instance to their respective log file.
