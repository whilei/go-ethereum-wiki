**Q.**  I noticed my peercount slowly decrease, and now it is at 0.  Restarting doesn't get any peers.

**A.**  Check and sync your clock with ntp.  [Example](http://askubuntu.com/questions/254826/how-to-force-a-clock-update-using-ntp) `sudo ntpdate -s time.nist.gov`

**Q.**  I would like to run multiple geth instances but got the error "Fatal: blockchain db err: resource temporarily unavailable".

**A.**  Geth uses a datadir to store the blockchain, accounts and some additional information. This directory cannot be shared between running instances. If you would like to run multiple instances follow [these](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/wiki/Setting-up-private-network-or-local-cluster) instructions.
